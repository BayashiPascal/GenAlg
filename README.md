# GenAlg
GenAlg is a C library providing structures and functions implementing a Genetic Algorithm.

The genes are memorized as a VecFloat and/or VecShort. The user can defined a range of possible values for each gene. The user can define the size of the pool of entities and the size of the breeding pool. Selection, reproduction and mutation are designed to efficiently explore all the possible gene combination, and avoid local optimum. It is also possible to save and load the GenAlg.
